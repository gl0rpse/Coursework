A project in C++ made to run on Visual Studio 2022 in which a user selects an image from their drive and is able to selectively blur out parts of that image and varying blur levels.
Utilizes OpenCV for the core, high gui, and image processing libraries.


Matrix variables are used for the image, and it traverses pixels along a 2D array with color shifts to represent a blurring effect on a selected area of the image using a mouse event function.
